Flickr photo oembed extracted in larger size, for wide and responsible themes.

== Description ==

Flickr\'s photo URL is automatically extracted as an embedded photo on WordPress, however, the default size of the photo is thumbnail size and for most case too small.

This simple plugin, let WordPress takes larger image from Flickr. The larger image would match better and more beautiful in wide themes.
